# react-scripts-eslintless

> This is a modified version of `react-scripts`. All `eslint` integration has been removed and `babel-plugin-styled-components` has been added to webpack config. See [create-react-app-eslintless](https://github.com/joserocha3/create-react-app-eslintless) for more information.

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
